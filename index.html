            It's a x-men character. X-men means the transformed human being with special ability. So his special ability was he had large and sharp bone made claws coming through his knuckles. But the villain transformed his bone made claws into metalic sharp blades and this made him stronger. After growing up I lost my interest on him but last year I had my crush again on him.

                What should I tell about him! He is cute and hot and also looks gentle. I can't remember when I had the first crush on him. At first I saw him as a x-men character and there his ability was he could control everyone's mind by his own. He is getting older but still attractive :-p

                He is cute and funny. I first saw him in a video clip of "Smile-Squad" in facebook. His smile is pretty. He is a cat-lover and his cat's name is Jewz. From one of his video I got the idea to make my sky-themed t-shirt. Here is that video-

                I got a crush on him from July,2020. Suddenly from my curiousity I was watching some video clips of BTS. Then I starten searching about BTS to know seven of their names. After that I just started to love them and still now I love them and their songs. I like all of them but like JK the most. He is soooo cute. His own song name is "Still With You"
