            It's a x-men character. X-men means the transformed human being with special ability. So his special ability was he had large and sharp bone made claws coming through his knuckles. But the villain transformed his bone made claws into metalic sharp blades and this made him stronger. After growing up I lost my interest on him but last year I had my crush again on him.
